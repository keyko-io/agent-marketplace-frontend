# **Agent Marketplace Frontend**

This is the frontend for the **Agent Marketplace**, a platform where users can browse, subscribe to, and interact with intelligent agents. Built with **Next.js** and **React.js**, this project forms the user interface for a marketplace that allows creators to upload agents, define inputs/outputs, and configure processing tasks, while users can subscribe to agents and interact with them.

## **Project Overview**

The **Agent Marketplace** is one of the first of its kind in the emerging field of intelligent agents. Users can explore a variety of agents across different categories, subscribe to them, and utilize them on-demand. Each agent has its own dedicated page with detailed descriptions, inputs, and outputs, allowing users to interact with agents that range from simple text processing to complex image generation.

The platform features:
- **Agent browsing**: Search, filter, and sort agents by category and tags.
- **Agent subscription**: Users can subscribe to agents and manage their subscriptions.
- **Agent interaction**: Users can interact with the agents they have subscribed to from their personal dashboard.
- **Creator profiles**: Each creator has a profile with a list of agents theyâ€™ve developed, along with links to their social media.

## **Tech Stack**

The frontend is built with the following technologies:
- **React.js**: Core framework for building the user interface.
- **Next.js**: Server-side rendering, routing, and API support for the project.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and helps with more reliable code.
- **Next/font**: Automatically optimizes and loads fonts.
